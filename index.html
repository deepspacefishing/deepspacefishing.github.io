<h1>Welcome to my site.</h1>
  <p>I write things. I have a manuscript that has been on the brink of completion for weeks. As a remedy to this, I recently cropped a significant portion of it to seed a spinoff. Unsatisfied, I simultaneously began a third book about something else entirely.</p>
  <p>A bit about me. I have programmed computers off and on since I was ten or so. When I was about twelve I watched October Sky and immediately began testing my own rocket fuels at the expense of one forest. I am a war veteran (Second Battalion, Second Marines) and a university trained mathematician. I have unpublished and incomplete original work in the sphere of financial investment that I hope to find in an old notebook one day, although my interests have shifted to space travel, deep ocean. I left the university as a junior to sell cars. Today, I run a construction company that I began without the faintest idea. Over the years I have discovered the odd clue but the whole thing is largely a work in process.</p>
  <p>I am convicted felon. Nothing lewd or macabre. I grew up in violence and it has been a seductive mistress. I grew up on phrases like, "an eye for an eye", "hit him where it hurts", and "vengeance is a dish best served cold", this last one never really finding application. I was never a big planner.</p>
  <p>One day I found myself temporarily paralyzed save for my eyeballs, my neck muscles, and a strained and slurred speech. It passed after a minute or so. I was absolutely exhausted in the following days and about a week later I sought help fearing a stroke would leave my wife alone. Medical investigations revealed nothing. Maybe stress. But ever since, I have experienced psychotic hallucinations nearly every day of the week. Usually it's a person that isn't there. On my morning commute the other day, I saw a man rappeling from a tree wearing a blue backpack. 'Interesting backpack', I thought before he vanished. On one occasion I heard a godlike voice commanding me to write my books for my dead sister's sake. Her stake in the matter I can't guess, beyond perhaps a from-the-grave jab at a cruel world that left her out in the cold. Although, I did begin years ago a writing project promising to explore my experiences wrestling with the loss of my childhood companion, my nearest sibling. Maybe this was the particular work that was being referenced. I'll write them all to cover my bases.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, here is a poem I wrote last night. It was a response to a fellow drunken internet troll and the genesis for this website. The poem required twenty minutes to write but I confess I stayed up until three am or so engaged in the business of securing a domain, researching inexpensive hosts, brushing up on html (light brushing), etc. The work is entitled "Fifth Generation".</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mete your meanness mostly</li>
    <li>As it suits you. In truth you</li>
    <li>Can’t be meaner than me.</li>
    <li>Your quarry’s ghostly.</li>
    <li>But I will serve this eve.</li>
    <li>When after night’s reprieve</li>
    <li>Sober you find yourself</li>
    <li>A loner deprived health</li>
    <li>Know I beat you there.</li>
    <li>No tonic dulls my stare</li>
    <li>Into this rotten mind.</li>
    <li>Not for lack of search</li>
    <li>Answers on this Earth</li>
    <li>I’ve yet to find.</li>
    <li>The mirror contuses</li>
    <li>My inquiring eye.</li>
    <li>Mistakes in 3D</li>
    <li>Rendered endlessly,</li>
    <li>Expending me,</li>
    <li>Relentlessly ending me,</li>
    <li>Upending me unendingly,</li>
    <li>This inward lense I see,</li>
    <li>Is untoward, cursed.</li>
    <li>Though I’m grim,</li>
    <li>It affects others worse</li>
    <li>I hope not him.</li>
    <li>Born into my curse.</li>
    <li>I’m afraid. Passengers</li>
    <li>On this crazy bus</li>
    <li>I’ve made. No fuss</li>
    <li>I bade. Let this plane</li>
    <li>Crash. I am gone.</li>
    <li>A young man. New.</li>
    <li>Yet muddled through</li>
    <li>Half my life again</li>
    <li>In an endless blue</li>
    <li>And red. Oscillating</li>
    <li>Sorrow, bloodlust.</li>
    <li>Like zombie not dead</li>
    <li>But also not alive.</li>
    <li>Years decayed.</li>
    <li>Friends left; I stayed.</li>
    <li>Bereft; depraved.</li>
    <li>A felon. No good.</li>
    <li>A criminal. Hood.</li>
    <li>Incompetent, psychotic</li>
    <li>Violent, neurotic.</li>
    <li>But it pleases me to song</li>
    <li>That you came along</li>
    <li>For no very good reason</li>
    <li>On your drunken day</li>
    <li>Of Independence</li>
    <li>To air your heavy transcendence</li>
    <li>And tell me of my treason.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>This next one was my first Haiku.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fur, paws, bark, and soul.</li>
      <li>Infinite depth. A dog’s love.</li>
      <li>Without, life is cold.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Some of my poems have weird themes. This no doubt is a consequence of poems often having themes and me often being weird.</p>
